// A concurrent, fixed-size hash table for caching JNI strings.

// This class is intended to reuse jstring instances for same-value native strings, and reduce
// the number of java.lang.String instances in memory that have the same underlying characters.
// To achieve this, clients call NewString or NewStringUTF on an instance of this cache to receive a
// jstring, instead of calling the similar methods on their JNIEnv. The returned jstring may be a
// new instance or a reused instance, and either way will contain the desired string characters.
//
// Eviction happens upon hash collision, i.e. when an element is inserted to the cache but the
// respective cache table entry is already occupied by a jstring with a different character value.
//
// This class is thread-safe.
